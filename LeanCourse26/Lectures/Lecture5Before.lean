# Practical remarks

* You are allowed to hand in homework alone or in pairs of 2.
-/

/- # Last time

Last time we saw:

* Disjunction `A ∨ B`
  - if you have `h : A ∨ B`, use
    `obtain ha | hb := h` to do a case split
  - to prove `A ∨ B`, use `left` or `right` to prove it.

* Negation `¬ A` means `A → False`.

* Main tactics for **Classical logic**:
  - `by_contra h` start a proof by contradiction.
  - `by_cases h : p` to start a proof by cases on statement `p`.
  - `push_neg` to push negations inside quantifiers and connectives.

/- ## Proving two functions are equal
To prove that two functions `f g : α → β` are equal, you can prove
that they are equal at every point, using the `ext` tactic.
`ext x` can prove that `f = g` if `f x = g x` for a new variable `x`.
-/

example {α β : Type*} {f g : α → β} (h : ∀ x, f x = g x) : f = g := by
  sorry

-- `rfl` can prove an equality `f = f`,
example : (fun n : ℤ ↦ n + 2) = (fun n : ℤ ↦ n + 2) := rfl

-- but once two functions are not "obviously" equal, you need `ext` to prove it.
example : (fun n : ℤ ↦ n + 2) = (fun n : ℤ ↦ n + 2 + 0) := by
  sorry

example : (fun n : ℤ ↦ 2 * n + 5) =
    (fun n : ℤ ↦ (n + 2) + (n + 6) - 3) := by

/- # Finding Lemmas

* You can shift-click on subexpressions in the infoview,
  and gives a list of possible lemmas to apply/rewrite there.
  (the command `#click_suggestions` at the top of the file enables this)

* Use tactics with a question mark to find a lemma.
  - `exact?` tries to apply a *single* lemma from the library
    to prove the current goal.
  - `apply?` tries to find all lemmas that can be used with `apply`
    to the current goal.

* Use `#leansearch "<query>."` to query theorems in natural language.
  More results are displayed on the website https://leansearch.net/

* Use https://loogle.lean-lang.org/ or its command
  `#loogle <query>`.

* Guess the name of the lemma
  - When typing a name, a list of suggested completions automatically
    shows up
  - You can also press `ctrl-space` (or `cmd-space` on a Mac)
    to see the list of suggestions.
  - Pressing `ctrl-space` toggles the display of the documentation
    of the selected completion.
  - You can also press `ctrl-T` (or `cmd-T`) to search for a lemma name
    (choosing an option shows you where it is proven)
  - You can search lemmas by name in the API documentation:
    https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/

  Some naming conventions:
  - a theorem named `A_of_B_of_C` establishes something of the form `A`
    from hypotheses of the form `B` and `C`.
  - `A`, `B`, and `C` approximate the way we might read the statement out loud.
  - Example: a theorem showing `x + y ≤ ...` will probably start with `add_le`.
    After typing `add_le` the autocomplete will give you some helpful choices.

* You can browse Mathlib
If you ctrl-click on a definition or theorem in VS Code you will jump
to the file where the theorem is proven.
Similar theorems are often proven together in the same file.

/-
We've introduced a lot of tactics.
You can find an overview of common tactics
in the **Tactic cheatsheet** of this repository.
-/



/- # Sets

In set theory you can make sets with arbitrary elements.
In Lean, all sets have to be sets of elements from a specific type.

If `s : Set α` then `s` is a set with elements from `α`.
-/

#check Set ℕ
#check Set ℝ

variable {α β ι : Type*} (x : α) (s t u : Set α)

/- We can talk about membership and (strict) subsets. -/

#check x ∈ s       -- \in or \mem
#check x ∉ s       -- \notin
#check s ⊆ t       -- \sub
#check s ⊂ t       -- \ssub


variable (y : β)

/- You are not allowed to ask if elements
from a different type are in a set. -/
-- #check y ∈ s


/- We have the common set-theoretic operations.
Note: it is important that `s` and `t`
are sets of elements from the *same* type. -/

#check s ∩ t       -- \inter or \cap
#check s ∪ t       -- \union or \cup
#check s \ t       -- the normal symbol `\` on your keyboard,
                   -- (use a space afterwards to not use the unicode-replacement)

#check sᶜ          -- \compl or \^c
#check (∅ : Set α) -- \empty
#check (Set.univ : Set α)

/- If you *open* a namespace, you are able to use names in it
without the prefix. -/

-- #check (univ : Set α)

open Set

#check (univ : Set α)






/- Showing that `x` is an element of
`s ∩ t`, `s ∪ t` or `sᶜ` corresponds by definition
to conjunction, disjunction or negation. -/

#check (mem_inter_iff x s t : x ∈ s ∩ t ↔ x ∈ s ∧ x ∈ t)
#check (mem_union x s t : x ∈ s ∪ t ↔ x ∈ s ∨ x ∈ t)
#check (mem_compl_iff s x : x ∈ sᶜ ↔ x ∉ s)
#check (mem_sdiff x : x ∈ s \ t ↔ x ∈ s ∧ x ∉ t)

#check (mem_univ x : x ∈ univ)
#check (notMem_empty x : x ∉ ∅)



/-
There are various ways to prove the following lemmas:
* use lemma `mem_inter_iff`
* use `simp`
* directly apply `constructor`
* give a direct proof: `⟨xs, xt⟩`
