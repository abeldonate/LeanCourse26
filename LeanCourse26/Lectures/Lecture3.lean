/- # Last week -/

/- Last week we saw
* everything has a type: objects (e.g. numbers, functions) and statements (Prop)
* you can prove statements using `tactics`: we saw
  - the `rfl` tactic (for trivial statements like `2 = 2`)
  - the `ring` tactic for proving identities in a (commutative) ring
  - the `rw` tactic for rewriting by an equation or equivalence
* `calc` blocks can make long calculation proofs more readable

* dealing with implications, forward and backward reasoning
  - forward reasoning: use `have` for intermediate goals; `intro` and `exact` to conclude a proof
  - `specialize` can also be used to apply a hypothesis to arguments
  - backward reasoning: use `apply` (or `exact` and `refine`)

# Difference between `rw` and `apply`
- `rw` can be used to rewrite a subexpression (almost) anywhere in the goal,
  `apply` has to match the outermost thing you are trying to prove.
- *generally* you use `rw` with an equality,
  and `apply` with implications and "for all" statements.

/- Often we can `apply` lemmas from Mathlib. -/

/- ## If and only if
* You can use `constructor` to prove an "if and only if" statement
* To use an "if and only if" statement `h`, you can use any of the following
  - `apply h.1`
  - `apply h.2`
  - `rw [h]`
  - `rw [← h]`

/- ## Universal quantification
The tactics for universal quantification and implication are the same.
* We can use `intro` to prove an universal quantification (or implication).
* We can use `apply` or `specialize` to use a hypothesis
  that is a universal quantification (or implication). -/


def Injective (f : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop := ∀ x y : ℝ, f x = f y → x = y

  -- unfold Injective
  -- intro x y hgf -- "Let x, y ∈ ℝ, suppose g(f(x)) = g(f(y))"
  -- specialize hg (f x) (f y) hgf -- "Because g is injective, we then have f(x) = f(y)"
  -- specialize hf x y hg -- "Because f is injective, we then have x = y"

  apply hf -- "Since f is injective, it suffices to show f(x) = f(y)"
  apply hg -- "Since g is injective, it suffices to show g(f(x)) = g(f(y))"

/- ## Conjunction

In Lean the conjunction of two statements `P` and `Q` is denoted by
`P ∧ Q`, read as "P and Q".

We can use a conjunction as follows:
* If `h : P ∧ Q` then `h.1 : P` and `h.2 : Q`.
* If `h : P ∧ Q ∧ R` then `h.2 : Q ∧ R`.
* To prove `P ∧ Q` use the `constructor` tactic.
Note that this is the same as for `↔`.

Furthermore, we can decompose conjunction and equivalences.
* If `h : P ∧ Q`, the tactic `obtain ⟨hP, hQ⟩ := h`
  gives two new assumptions `hP : P` and `hQ : Q`.
* If `h : P ↔ Q`, the tactic `obtain ⟨hPQ, hQP⟩ := h`
  gives two new assumptions `hPQ : P → Q` and `hQP : Q → P`.
* Equivalences behave very similarly to equalities, if
  `h : P ↔ Q`, then `rw [h]` will replace `P` with `Q` in the goal.

/- ## Existential quantifiers -/


/-
In order to prove `∃ x, P x`, we give some `x₀` using tactic `use x₀` and
then prove `P x₀`. This `x₀` can be any expression.
You can also use `exact ⟨x₀, hPx₀⟩`, where `hPx₀ : P x₀`.

In order to use `h : ∃ x, P x`, we use can use
`obtain ⟨x₀, hx₀⟩ := h`
to fix one `x₀` that works.

example {α : Type*} [PartialOrder α]
    (isDense : ∀ x y : α, x < y → ∃ z : α, x < z ∧ z < y)
    (x y : α) (hxy : x < y) :
    ∃ z₁ z₂ : α, x < z₁ ∧ z₁ < z₂ ∧ z₂ < y := by
  -- first find z₂ between x and y
  obtain ⟨z₂, hz₂⟩ := isDense x y hxy
  -- then find z₁ between x and z₂
  obtain ⟨z₁, hz₁⟩ := isDense x z₂ hz₂.1
  use z₁, z₂
  exact ⟨hz₁.1, hz₁.2, hz₂.2⟩

/- ## Disjunctions -/

/-
Lean denotes by `∨` the logical OR operator.

In order to directly prove a goal `P ∨ Q`,
we use either the `left` tactic and prove `P` or the `right`
tactic and prove `Q`.

In order to make use of an assumption
  `h : P ∨ Q`
we use the obtain tactic:
  `obtain hP | hQ := h`
which creates two proof branches: one branch assuming `hP : P`,
and one branch assuming `hQ : Q`.

/- ## Negation

The negation `¬ A` just means `A → False`,
where `False` is a statement without a proof.
We can use the same tactics as for implication:
`intro` to prove a negation, and `apply` to use one. -/

  sorry

example {α : Type*} {p : α → Prop} : ¬ (∃ x, p x) ↔ ∀ x, ¬ p x := by

/- We can use `exfalso` to use the fact that
everything follows from `False`: ex falso quod libet -/

/- `contradiction` proves any goal
when two hypotheses are contradictory. -/
example {p : Prop} (h : ¬ p) : p → 0 = 1 := by
  sorry







/-
We can use classical reasoning (with the law of the excluded middle)
using the following tactics.

* `by_contra h` start a proof by contradiction.
* `by_cases h : p` to start a proof by cases on statement `p`.
* `push Not` to push negations inside quantifiers and connectives.
